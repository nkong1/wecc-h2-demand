Hey there!

This model generates hourly hydrogen demand profiles for the transportation and industrial sectors across each load zone in the WECC. The transportation sector is further broken down into light-duty and heavy-duty transport, and the industrial sector is further broken down into key hard-to-decarbonize industries: Iron & Steel, Aluminum, Cement, Chemicals, Glass, and Fertilizer. 

Currently a work in progress.
