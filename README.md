# WECC Hydrogen Demand Model

This model generates hourly hydrogen demand profiles from the on-road transport and industrial sectors across 47 load zones in the WECC and input model years. The transportation sector is further broken down into light-duty and heavy-duty on-road transport, and the industrial sector is further broken down into key hard-to-decarbonize industries: Iron & Steel, Aluminum, Cement, Chemicals, Glass, and Fertilizer. 

The outputs of this model are made to be compatible with SWITCH WECC.

Currently a work in progress. Thanks for reading!
