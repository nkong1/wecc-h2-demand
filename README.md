# WECC Hydrogen Demand Model

Hi there!

This model generates hourly hydrogen demand profiles from the transportation and industrial sectors across every load zone in the WECC, for an entire model year. The transportation sector is further broken down into light-duty and heavy-duty on-road transport, and the industrial sector is further broken down into key hard-to-decarbonize industries: Iron & Steel, Aluminum, Cement, Chemicals, Glass, and Fertilizer. 

The outputs of this model are made to be compatible with the SWITCH WECC model.

Currently a work in progress.
